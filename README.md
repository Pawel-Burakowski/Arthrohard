## :scroll: Project description

An online shop application (SPA) with products fetched via the API. In the project I used the VUE3 framework, the components were styled using Tailwind CSS and axios is responsible for retrieving data from the API. The website is responsive, has a background with parallax effect and the possibility to load data dynamically (on scroll mouse)
